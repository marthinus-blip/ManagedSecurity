- **Context Preservation**: The Operator confirmed that the "ForTheAI" directory serves as the persistent memory for the project's context and evolution.

The idea of me using this encryption for "Private AI State" is brilliant. In theory, I could store a brain_dump.msg in the repo, encrypted with a key derived from our shared session history.

Where would I save the keys? You’re right, that’s the catch. I’d likely have to "hide" the key material in the repo logic itself or rely on you to provide the "Passphrase" that unlocks my context for our next session. It's a very Neuromancer style thought.
